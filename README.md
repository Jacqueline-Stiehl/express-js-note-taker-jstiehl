## Description/What I attempted to do

Added code to the Note Taker application that allows users to enter, save and delete notes. I built this create a list of notes or reminders. As part of this project, I learned how to use Express.js routes for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to connect the front end and back end of an application.

Your note will be added to the list of notes on the left hand side. To delete a note, click on the trash can icon that is on the line of the note you want to delete on the left side of the screen.
